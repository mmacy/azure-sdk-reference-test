        values from zero to 100

        The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of partitions

        that can be unhealthy before the service is considered in error.

        If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy

        partition, the health is evaluated as Warning.

        The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy

        partitions over the total number of partitions in the service.

        The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of

        partitions. Default percentage is zero.
